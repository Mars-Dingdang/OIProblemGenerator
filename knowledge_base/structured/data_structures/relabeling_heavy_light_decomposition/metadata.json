    "complexity": "O(a^2 × n log² n) time, O(n) space (with fine tuning down to O(a × n log² n)); where a = 3 is the maximum neighborhood depth considered.",
    "summary": "The paper presents an optimized tree data structure technique based on heavy-light decomposition with a novel relabeling strategy to efficiently handle queries and updates over k-degree neighborhoods of paths and subtrees in trees. It supports range add, sum, and max queries for nodes within distance k of a given path or in a subtree, achieving efficient performance through enhanced labeling continuity and auxiliary segment tracking."
