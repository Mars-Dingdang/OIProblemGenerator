    "complexity": "O(λ_s(n) log n) for preprocessing, O(log n) per query with fractional cascading; for kinetic tournament trees: O(λ_{s+2}(n + m) log^2 n + q) time for m modifications and q queries, where λ_s(n) is nearly linear (e.g., O(n α(n)) for s=3).",
    "summary": "The paper discusses dynamic maintenance of the pointwise maximum (or minimum) over a set of functions, leveraging Davenport-Schinzel sequences to bound the complexity of function envelopes. It improves upon classical problems such as range-addition of arithmetic progressions and insertion of line segments in the plane (extending Li-Chao Tree). The key idea is to use structural properties of function intersections (bounded by DS sequence order s) to achieve efficient amortized complexities, especially when queries are monotonic or updates follow certain patterns."
