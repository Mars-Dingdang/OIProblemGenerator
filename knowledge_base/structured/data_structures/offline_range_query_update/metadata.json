    "summary": "This paper presents an offline algorithm for range modification and query problems where the data satisfies dual semigroup properties. The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach on the operation sequence, maintaining a dynamic rooted forest of equivalence classes. It achieves optimal algebraic operation complexity by merging and splitting these classes efficiently during recursion."
