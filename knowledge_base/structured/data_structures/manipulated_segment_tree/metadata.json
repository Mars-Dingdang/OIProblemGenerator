    "summary": "Given a custom segment tree where the split point (mid) of each node is arbitrarily given, support two operations: rotating a node with its parent (similar to splay rotations), and querying the number of nodes in the tree required to exactly cover a given interval [l, r] — known as the 'interval localization count'. The challenge lies in efficiently maintaining the dynamic structure under rotation and answering queries quickly despite potentially linear depth."
