    "summary": "This paper explores advanced applications of the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure in competitive programming, focusing on three specialized models: linear tree-based Union-Find for path queries, weighted Union-Find for maintaining relative values within sets, and rollback (undoable) Union-Find using heuristic merging. These models are demonstrated through various problems involving offline query processing, sequence partitioning, LCA computation, dynamic connectivity, and more."
