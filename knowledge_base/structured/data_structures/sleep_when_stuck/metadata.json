    "summary": "Given n levels in a game, each with initial ease value ai and boredom value bi, the player can choose an order to complete them. If level i is completed at position j, its ease becomes ai + j*k and boredom becomes bi + j*k. The overall ease is the minimum of all adjusted ease values, and overall boredom is the maximum of all adjusted boredom values. The goal is to maximize (ease - boredom). The solution involves binary search on the answer, using properties of monotonic constraints and Hall's theorem to check feasibility via data structures."
