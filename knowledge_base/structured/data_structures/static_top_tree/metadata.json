    "summary": "The paper introduces static Top Tree, a data structure used to represent trees and generalized series-parallel graphs via cluster operations (compress, rake, twist). It discusses applications including information maintenance via pushup, point-divide on Top Tree, and constructing tree or graph block decompositions. The method supports efficient dynamic updates and queries on tree-based and generalized series-parallel graph problems by leveraging hierarchical clustering and recursive decomposition."
