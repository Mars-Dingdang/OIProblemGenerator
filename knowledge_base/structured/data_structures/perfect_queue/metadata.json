    "summary": "Given n queues with capacity limits a_i and m operations, each inserting element x into all queues in the interval [l, r], elements are automatically popped from the front if a queue exceeds its capacity. After each operation, compute the number of distinct elements across all queues. The solution leverages offline processing,分块 (blocking), and two-pointer techniques to efficiently compute when each operation's inserted elements are fully removed, enabling efficient updates to the global distinct element count."
