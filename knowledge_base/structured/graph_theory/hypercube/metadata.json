    "summary": "The paper explores the hypercube graph Qn, a highly symmetric structure with 2^n vertices and edges between nodes differing in exactly one bit. It covers definitions, structural views (Cartesian product, spherical layers), graph properties (bipartiteness, diameter, independent sets, perfect matchings), applications in algorithmic problems (isomorphism testing, coloring, Hamiltonian cycles), and advanced topics like Dilworth's theorem, Sperner's theorem, Möbius inversion, and magic labelings. The hypercube model connects combinatorics, order theory, and competitive programming."
