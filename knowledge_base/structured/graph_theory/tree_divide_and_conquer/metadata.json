    "summary": "The paper discusses three tree-based divide-and-conquer techniques: edge centroid decomposition (edge divide), vertex centroid decomposition (point divide), and globally balanced binary trees. These methods are used to solve path or connectivity-related problems on trees by recursively decomposing the tree structure and solving subproblems efficiently."
