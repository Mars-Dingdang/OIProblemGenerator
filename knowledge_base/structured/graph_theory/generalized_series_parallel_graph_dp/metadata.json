    "summary": "Given a generalized series-parallel graph where each node has two weights (black/white) and each edge has two weights (same/different color), find the maximum total weight coloring of nodes. Support dynamic updates to node or edge weights. The solution uses reduction operations (remove degree-1 nodes, contract degree-2 nodes, merge multi-edges) to build an expression tree, then applies heavy-light decomposition with segment trees maintaining matrix-like transitions under (max, +) algebra for efficient updates."
