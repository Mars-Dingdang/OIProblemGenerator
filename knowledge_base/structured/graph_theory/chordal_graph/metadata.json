    "summary": "A chordal graph is an undirected graph in which every cycle of length greater than 3 has a chord. Many NP-hard problems on general graphs, such as graph coloring, maximum independent set, and minimum clique cover, can be solved efficiently on chordal graphs using properties like perfect elimination ordering and clique trees. The paper discusses structural properties, recognition algorithms (via maximum cardinality search), and applications in competitive programming."
