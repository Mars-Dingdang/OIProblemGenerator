    "summary": "The paper discusses the concept of tree width and its applications in solving classical graph problems efficiently on graphs with bounded tree width. It introduces tree decomposition, properties of k-trees and partial k-trees, and demonstrates how dynamic programming can be applied on tree decompositions—especially perfect or smooth ones—to solve problems like maximum independent set and shortest path in linear or near-linear time when tree width is bounded by a constant."
