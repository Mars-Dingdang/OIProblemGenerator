    "summary": "The paper explores algorithms for the dynamic transitive closure problem in directed graphs, which involves maintaining reachability information under edge insertions and deletions. It covers static methods (Floyd-Warshall, SCC, topological sorting), partially dynamic approaches supporting only insertions (e.g., tree-merging and incremental updates), and fully dynamic solutions using offline segment trees or randomized linear algebra techniques based on matrix determinant and inverse maintenance."
