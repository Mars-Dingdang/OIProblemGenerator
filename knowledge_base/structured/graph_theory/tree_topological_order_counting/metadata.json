    "summary": "This paper discusses methods for counting tree topological orders, which involve combinatorial problems related to enumerating valid orderings of nodes in a tree under specific constraints. The focus is on leveraging algebraic and number-theoretic techniques, including Dirichlet convolutions, generating functions, and advanced data structures, to efficiently compute these counts."
