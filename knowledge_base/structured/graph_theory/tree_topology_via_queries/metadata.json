    "summary": "Given a hidden tree of n nodes, the task is to reconstruct its structure using an interactive query: for a given point set S and node x, determine whether x lies in the minimal connected subtree (i.e., the smallest subtree) containing all nodes in S. The solution involves transforming the problem into determining a topological order of the rooted tree by leveraging tree properties such as ancestor-descendant relationships, leaf pruning, or divide-and-conquer strategies."
