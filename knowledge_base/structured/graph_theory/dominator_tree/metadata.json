    "summary": "The paper discusses the dominator tree of a directed graph, which represents the dominance relationships from a source node s: a node x dominates y if every path from s to y passes through x. The immediate dominator (idom) of a node is the last dominator on the path from s, and connecting each node to its idom forms a tree called the dominator tree. This structure allows efficient computation of dominance relations and has applications in areas such as control flow analysis, strong articulation points, and bridge detection in directed graphs."
