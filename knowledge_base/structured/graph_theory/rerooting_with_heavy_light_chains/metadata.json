    "summary": "The paper discusses a class of tree rerooting problems where information must be maintained when changing the root of a tree. It focuses on using heavy-light decomposition (HLD) and long-chain decomposition to efficiently maintain subtree and complement-subtree information during rerooting, especially for depth-related or convex hull-based DP states. Key techniques include maintaining arrays along chains, handling light children separately, and using data structures like segment trees or heaps for efficient merging and querying."
