    "summary": "The Minimum In-Branching Forest problem involves finding a subgraph with exactly k edges in a weighted directed graph such that every weakly connected component is an in-branching (an arborescence where all edges point toward the root), and the total edge weight is minimized. The paper presents an efficient O(E log E) algorithm based on priority-based expansion of in-trees, leveraging properties from matroid theory and convex optimization insights."
