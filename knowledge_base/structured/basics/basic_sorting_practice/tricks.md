# 基础排序算法练习题

The provided text for this specific paper is either missing or severely corrupted. While the title suggests it should cover basic sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, etc., with their typical time complexities (e.g., O(N²) for simple sorts, O(N log N) for efficient ones), no such information is present. The visible text discusses advanced topics:

- **Multiplicative Functions**: Functions like Euler's totient function φ(n) and the divisor function σ_k(n) that satisfy f(ab)=f(a)f(b) for coprime a,b.
- **Dirichlet Convolution**: A binary operation on arithmetic functions defined as (f ∗ g)(n) = Σ_{d|n} f(d)g(n/d), which forms a ring structure.
- **Möbius Inversion**: A fundamental theorem stating that if f(n) = Σ_{d|n} g(d), then g(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d)f(n/d), where μ is the Möbius function.
- **Linear Programming & Duality**: Concepts like the simplex method, primal-dual relationships, and formulating problems such as maximum flow (primal) and minimum cut (dual).
- **Graph Algorithms**: Mentions of Gomory-Hu trees, Stoer-Wagner algorithm, and Karger's algorithm for finding minimum cuts in graphs.

None of these concepts are relevant to 'basic sorting algorithms'. It is likely that the wrong document fragment was included in the prompt.
