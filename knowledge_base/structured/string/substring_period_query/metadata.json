    "summary": "The paper addresses the substring period query problem: given a string S and multiple queries of the form (l, r), determine all periods of the substring S[l..r]. Using properties of periodicity (e.g., Weak Periodicity Lemma) and a data structure called Dictionary of Basic Factors (DBF), the solution achieves O(n log n) preprocessing time and space, with O(log n) expected time per query. The set of periods is compactly represented using O(log n) arithmetic progressions."
