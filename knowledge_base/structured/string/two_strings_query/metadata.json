    "summary": "Given two strings A and B, and a series of operations that modify string A (inserting characters at specific positions), answer queries about how many times string B appears as a contiguous substring in the current version of A. The challenge lies in efficiently maintaining and querying substring occurrences after dynamic modifications."
