    "summary": "Given a string P of length n and m queries, each query asks for the number of nodes in the suffix tree of substring P[l, r]. The solution leverages properties of suffix trees and suffix automata, using techniques like dynamic trees, segment trees, binary search, hashing, and启发式合并 (heavy-light merging) to efficiently handle multiple interval queries. A key insight is that node contributions can be tracked via changes in 'last' and 'diff' positions of substrings, and repeated contributions are handled via monotonicity and binary search."
