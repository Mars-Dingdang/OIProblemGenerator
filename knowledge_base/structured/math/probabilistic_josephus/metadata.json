    "summary": "The paper studies a class of probabilistic Josephus problems where, in a circular arrangement of n positions, a pointer moves from position 1, and at each step the current position disappears with probability p before the pointer moves right. The goal is to compute various probability or expectation values, such as the probability that a given element is the last to disappear, the probability it is the i-th to disappear, or the expected lexicographic rank of the resulting elimination sequence."
