    "summary": "The paper discusses applications of finite fields of characteristic 2 in solving two NP-hard problems in competitive programming: the longest simple path problem and the Maximum Graph Motif problem. By leveraging algebraic constructions over F_{2^v} and using randomization, it designs probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms (in terms of parameterized complexity) that determine existence of solutions via non-vanishing polynomials. The key idea is to cancel out invalid configurations (e.g., repeated vertices or color-number conflicts) using the property a + a = 0 in characteristic 2 fields."
