    "summary": "The paper discusses the application of generating functions to solve dice-rolling problems in algorithmic competitions, particularly focusing on expected stopping times when certain sequences or patterns appear. It demonstrates how probability generating functions and auxiliary ordinary generating functions can model stochastic processes, enabling efficient computation of expectations and variances without complex dynamic programming or Gaussian elimination."
