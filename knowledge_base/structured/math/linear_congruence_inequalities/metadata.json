    "summary": "The paper discusses a class of problems involving linear congruence inequalities, both single and systems. It presents efficient algorithms to find the minimal solution of a single inequality using a Euclidean-like recursive method, and for systems, it introduces a 'prime exponent halving' technique to compute solution frequency and the minimal period of solutions by reducing the problem into coprime modulus cases via smart modulus decomposition."
