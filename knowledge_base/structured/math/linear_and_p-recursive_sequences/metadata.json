    "summary": "The paper discusses two types of recurrence sequences: linearly recursive sequences and P-recursive (polynomially recursive) sequences. It covers their definitions, fundamental properties, algorithms for finding minimal recurrence relations, and methods to compute the n-th term efficiently. Applications include optimizing dynamic programming, computing matrix minimum polynomials, solving sparse linear systems, and counting combinatorial structures using generating functions."
