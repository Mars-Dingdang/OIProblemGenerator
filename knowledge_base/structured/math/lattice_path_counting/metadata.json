    "summary": "The paper discusses advanced techniques for counting lattice paths and related number-theoretic summations, focusing on efficient computation of multiplicative function prefix sums using Dirichlet convolutions, power series (Exp/Log), and optimized sieve methods. It presents algorithms achieving sub-linear time complexities such as O(n^{2/3}) and improved bounds like O(√n poly log n) by leveraging structural properties of powerful numbers and segmented sieves."
