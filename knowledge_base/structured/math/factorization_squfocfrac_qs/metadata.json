    "summary": "The paper discusses three advanced integer factorization algorithms—SQUFOF, CFRAC, and Quadratic Sieve (QS)—that go beyond basic trial division. These methods leverage number-theoretic properties such as continued fractions, smooth numbers, and congruences of squares to efficiently decompose large integers into prime factors, making them suitable for competitive programming problems involving large numbers."
