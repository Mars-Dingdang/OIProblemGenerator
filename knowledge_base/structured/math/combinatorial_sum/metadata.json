    "summary": "Given integers n, m, d, and M, compute the XOR of f(j) for j from 0 to m-1, where f(j) is the sum of binomial coefficients C(i*d, j) modulo M for i from 0 to n-1. The problem involves advanced number theory techniques including Lucas's Theorem, Chinese Remainder Theorem, formal power series, and polynomial division under modular arithmetic with composite moduli."
