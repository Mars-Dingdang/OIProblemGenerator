    "summary": "The paper discusses advanced techniques for summing special number-theoretic functions, focusing on three main parts: a simplified version of the sieve method for multiplicative functions (known as Min_25 sieve), efficient computation of prime power sums using Meissel-Lehmer-like methods, and an innovative geometric approach using Stern-Brocot Tree to compute divisor summatory functions by counting lattice points under hyperbolas."
