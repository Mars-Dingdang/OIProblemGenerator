    "summary": "The paper discusses the application of lattice algorithms, particularly the LLL algorithm, to factor integer-coefficient polynomials. It reduces polynomial factorization to finding short vectors in a lattice constructed from the polynomial's coefficients and uses properties of lattices to recover non-trivial factors efficiently."
