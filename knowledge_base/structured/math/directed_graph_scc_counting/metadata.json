    "summary": "Given a set S of allowed sizes for strongly connected components (SCCs), compute the expected number of SCCs with in-degree 0 in all labeled directed graphs of size i (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n), where each SCC's size must belong to S. The answer is computed modulo 998244353 using generating functions and combinatorial identities."
