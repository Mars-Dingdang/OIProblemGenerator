    "summary": "This paper explores the application of Lagrange multipliers and duality theory in competitive programming (OI). It introduces how to transform constrained optimization problems into dual forms using Lagrange functions, enabling the use of min-max theorems and convex analysis. The method is applied to various OI problems involving linear programming duality, resource allocation, and combinatorial constraints, demonstrating its utility in simplifying complex optimization tasks."
