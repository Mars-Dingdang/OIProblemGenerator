## Key Observations and Tricks

1. **Ideal as Kernel**: Every ring homomorphism's kernel is an ideal. Conversely, every ideal is the kernel of some homomorphism (via quotient ring).
2. **Quotient Ring Construction**: For ideal I in ring R, the quotient ring R/I is formed by cosets a+I. Operations are well-defined iff I is an ideal.
3. **Isomorphism Theorems**: Analogous to group theory, they relate rings, ideals, and homomorphisms (e.g., first isomorphism: R/ker φ ≅ im φ).
4. **Maximal vs Prime Ideals**: In commutative rings with unity:
   - Maximal ideal ⇔ quotient is a field.
   - Prime ideal ⇔ quotient is an integral domain.
   - Every maximal ideal is prime, but not conversely unless in a PID.
5. **Principal Ideal Domains (PIDs)**: All ideals are generated by a single element. Examples: Z, F[x] (polynomials over a field). In PIDs, irreducible ⇔ prime.
6. **Euclidean Domains (ED)**: Have a Euclidean function (norm) allowing division algorithm. Every ED is a PID, but not vice versa (e.g., Z[√-19]).
7. **Unique Factorization Domains (UFDs)**: Every non-zero non-unit factors uniquely into irreducibles (up to order and associates). All PIDs are UFDs.
8. **Polynomial Rings**: If R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain. If R is a UFD, then R[x] is a UFD (Gauss's Lemma).
9. **Chinese Remainder Theorem for Rings**: For pairwise coprime ideals I₁,...,Iₙ, R/(∩Iᵢ) ≅ ∏ R/Iᵢ.
10. **Ideal Arithmetic**: Sum, product, intersection of ideals correspond to gcd, lcm, and combinations in Z (e.g., nZ + mZ = gcd(n,m)Z).
11. **Quadratic Integer Rings**: Z[√D] are integral domains. Norm N(a+b√D)=a²-Db² is multiplicative. Use norm to study irreducibility and Euclidean property.
12. **Dedekind Domains**: All non-zero ideals factor uniquely into prime ideals. Quadratic integer rings are Dedekind domains, even if not UFDs.

## Common Problem Transformations
- **Modular Arithmetic**: View Z/nZ as quotient ring Z/(n).
- **Polynomial Congruences**: Work in F[x]/(f(x)) for field F.
- **Ideal Membership**: Test if element belongs to ideal via generators (in PIDs, check divisibility).
- **Maximal/Irreducible**: To show an ideal is maximal, prove quotient is a field; for irreducible element in PID, show it generates a maximal ideal.
- **Non-UFD Examples**: Use Z[√-5] where 9 has two distinct factorizations.
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: Works in Euclidean domains (e.g., Z, F[x]) to compute gcd.
- **Lifting Solutions**: Use CRT for rings to combine solutions modulo coprime ideals.
