    "summary": "The paper introduces the concept of 'recursive polynomials' and provides a detailed analysis of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which computes the shortest linear recurrence (minimal generating polynomial) for a given sequence over any field. It discusses theoretical foundations, efficient implementation, and applications in counting recurrence relations, computing characteristic polynomials of sparse matrices, determinants, and spanning tree counts in graphs."
