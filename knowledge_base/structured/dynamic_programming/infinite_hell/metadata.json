    "summary": "The problem asks to count the number of ways to partition integers 1 to n into three unordered sets such that no two elements from different sets have their sum in the third set. The solution involves deep combinatorial observations, number-theoretic reasoning (especially gcd and modular structure), and optimized dynamic programming using Möbius inversion and number-theoretic sieving techniques."
