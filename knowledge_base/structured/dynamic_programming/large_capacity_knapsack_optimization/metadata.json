    "summary": "The paper discusses optimization techniques for large-capacity knapsack problems in competitive programming, focusing on reducing the effective problem size using greedy preprocessing, number theory (such as modular arithmetic and the Frobenius problem), and divide-and-conquer strategies. It presents methods to transform complete and multiple knapsack problems into smaller-scale versions independent of the large capacity M, achieving better time complexity when W or V is small."
