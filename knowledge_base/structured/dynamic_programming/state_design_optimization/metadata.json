    "scenarios": "Optimizing DP by redesigning the state definition rather than just the transition. Often used when naive state leads to high complexity, but problem constraints or properties allow a more compact representation.",
    "extensions": "Common in problems like LCS with large n and small m, or when answer is bounded."
