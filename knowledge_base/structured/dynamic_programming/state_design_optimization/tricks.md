- **Key Observation**: In LCS with n >> m, note that answer ≤ m. This allows using a greedy or optimized DP that focuses on matches.
- **State Redefinition**: Instead of dp[i][j], use dp[j] with rolling array, and track previous diagonal value to handle matches.
- **Complexity Reduction**: From O(nm) to O(nm) but with much smaller memory, or sometimes O(n log m) using binary search for LIS-like transformations.
- **General Approach**: Look for bounds on answer or state values; if one dimension is much smaller, try to eliminate the larger dimension by iterating over it and updating states for the smaller dimension.
- **Common Patterns**:
  - When answer is small, state can be defined in terms of answer value.
  - Use bitset for boolean DP to speed up transitions.
  - Convert problem to another known problem (e.g., LCS to LIS when one sequence has distinct elements).
