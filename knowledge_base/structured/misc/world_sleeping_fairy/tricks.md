# 《世界沉睡童话》命题报告

**Author:** 叶李蹊

The provided text for the paper '《世界沉睡童话》命题报告' (World Sleeping Fairy) is severely corrupted and does not contain the actual content of the paper.

Instead, the text begins with material from a different paper titled "关于积性函数求和问题的一些进展" (Some Progress on Summation Problems of Multiplicative Functions) by Zhou Kangyang. This section discusses:

*   **Multiplicative Functions:** Definitions of common multiplicative functions like the Möbius function `µ`, Euler's totient function `ϕ`, and Dirichlet convolution.
*   **Powerful Numbers:** A definition and proof about powerful numbers (numbers where every prime factor has exponent at least 2).
*   **Summation Techniques:** An in-depth discussion of algorithms for summing multiplicative functions over a range `[1, n]`. This includes:
    *   The use of Dirichlet convolutions to relate sums of different functions.
    *   The "Dirichlet Hyperbola Method" for achieving sub-linear time complexity.
    *   Advanced optimization techniques using generating functions (`exp` and `log`) to handle more complex multiplicative functions, aiming for complexities like `O(n^1/2 poly log n)`.
    *   Detailed proofs and complexity analyses for these methods.

After this extensive section on number theory, the text then jumps to papers by Guo Yuchong on "Linear Matroid Parity" and Huang Luotian on "Data Structure Merging and Splitting", before finally listing the title of Ye Lixi's paper.

**Conclusion:** The actual content of the 'World Sleeping Fairy' problem is entirely absent from the provided text. The only information available is the title and author, while the body of the text is a mix of other authors' work, making it impossible to extract any meaningful details about the intended algorithm or problem.
