### Key Observations and Tricks

- **Direct Construction**: The $k$-bit Gray code sequence can be generated by reflecting the $(k-1)$-bit sequence and prefixing with 0s and 1s respectively.

- **Bitwise Formula**: $G(n) = n \oplus \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, which allows $O(1)$ computation of the $n$-th Gray code.

- **Inverse Transformation**: To recover $n$ from Gray code $g$, traverse from high to low bits: each bit of $n$ is the cumulative XOR of all higher bits in $g$. This yields $n = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{k} g_i$ progressively.

- **Efficient Inverse**: Use iterative XOR shift: `n ^= g; g >>= 1;` until `g` becomes zero. Avoids explicit bit indexing.

- **Applications**: Useful in backtracking problems where minimizing state transitions (e.g., one-bit change) reduces complexity, such as in certain DP optimizations or cyclic enumeration.

- **Cyclic Property**: The sequence is cyclic — the last and first codes also differ by one bit.
