    "summary": "This paper discusses common techniques for solving construction problems in algorithm competitions, including the pigeonhole principle, DFS trees, and recursion. It presents several example problems such as Errich-Tac-Toe, Mine Sweeper II, Ehab's Last Corollary, Scenic Walkway Partition, Baggage, and Strange Housing, illustrating how to apply these methods to construct valid solutions under given constraints."
