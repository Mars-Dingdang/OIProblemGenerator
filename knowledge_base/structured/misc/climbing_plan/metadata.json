    "summary": "The paper discusses an algorithmic problem involving a mountain range represented by points on a plane. The goal is to compute the distance each point must travel to reach the peak, where visibility between points is determined by line-of-sight over the terrain. The solution involves preprocessing visible left and right peaks for each point, then using a divide-and-conquer or data structure approach to efficiently compute the total path length based on these visibility relationships."
