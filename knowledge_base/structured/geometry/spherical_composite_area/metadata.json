    "summary": "The paper presents an efficient algorithm to compute the exact area of a composite region on a sphere formed by Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference) over n spherical caps. The input is given as a Boolean expression of length m, and the algorithm computes the area in O(nm log m) worst-case time complexity using Green's theorem and a data structure based on heavy-light decomposition to maintain dynamic evaluations of the expression during a sweep-line process."
