    "summary": "Given N integer-coordinate points (lattice points) in the plane, count the number of distinct subsets of points that form a regular polygon with at least 3 vertices, where each selected point must lie on the convex hull of the input set and cannot be strictly inside any triangle formed by other given points. The solution leverages deep geometric and number-theoretic properties of lattice points, particularly that only regular quadrilaterals (squares) can exist among regular polygons with all vertices on lattice points."
